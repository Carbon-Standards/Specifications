# PSocket v1

## Connect to Socket

Clients should be able to connect to the socket defined by the `/v1/` endpoint.

Servers may optionaly check any request headers before upgrading the request. For example, a server may check the `Host` header provided by the client before choosing to establish a connection.

PSocket servers may terminate the underlying WebSocket connection at any time for any reason. Clients should be able to detect this and reconnect if needed. Request/Response errors should not terminate this connection.

If a connection gets terminated, the server will dispose of all outgoing requests/responses and WebSocket connections.

## Request a remote resource

All requests are made via a WebSocket message. If the message is text, it is JSON stringified meta information about a given request (eg. url, headers, body size, etc). If the message is binary, its content for either request/response body or a remote WebSocket message.

A `PSocketRequest` can request and send resources through any standard HTTP method.

```ts
type PSocketRequest = {
  /**
   * A 32 character HEX string identifying the request.
   *
   * This should be randomly generated uppon each request in order to ensure there are no response collisions.
   * If this isn't set, the server will respond with an error.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * This value is used by the server to determine what kind of action is being completed.
   *
   * This value may be one of seven different values.
   *
   * ``"request" | "response" | "connect" | "open" | "close" | "message" | "error"`
   */
  type: "request";
  /**
   * A string to set request's method.
   *
   * If an invalid HTTP method is provided, the server will respond with an error.
   */
  method: string;
  /**
   * The remote URL.
   *
   * If this isn't set, the server will respond with an error.
   */
  url: string;
  /**
   * Headers to be sent to the remote.
   *
   * Note that no other headers apart from what is specified here will be sent to the remote.
   */
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  /**
   * An integer value representing the size of the body in bytes.
   *
   * If set, the server will wait for the full body to be recieved before making any requests.
   */
  body?: number;
};
```

### Sending request body

Request and response bodies are sent as multiple packets that may not exceed the server's `maxPacketSize` limit. If the `body` property is set on the initial request, the server will wait for all body packets to arrive before begining the request to the remote. The implementation may choose a timeout length for recieving all body parts. If any body packets are missing by this timeout, the server will respond with an error.

The request body is split into packets with a limit as defined by the server. This limit must be above 512 bytes.

The first 16 bytes are reserved for the HEX encoded request ID. `[id, id, id, id, x12]`

The next 2 bytes define the current index of the packet for the given resource. `[index, index]`

The remaining bytes can be used to serialze the request body.

## Recieving responses

Responses will be sent in the form of a `PSocketResponse` object and body packets.

```ts
type PSocketResponse = {
  /**
   * The 32 character HEX string identifying the response.
   *
   * This id represents which `PSocketRequest` the given response corelates to.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * This value is used by the client to determine what kind of action is being completed.
   *
   * This value may be one of seven different values.
   *
   * ``"request" | "response" | "connect" | "open" | "close" | "message" | "error"`
   */
  type: "response";
  /**
   * The final URL provided by the response.
   *
   * This may differ from the request URL if the server redirected the request.
   */
  url: string;
  /**
   * The HTTP status code provided by the remote resource.
   */
  status: number;
  /**
   * The HTTP status text provided by the remote resource.
   */
  statusText: string;
  /**
   * The response headers provided by the remote.
   */
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  /**
   * An integer value representing the size of the body in bytes.
   *
   * If set, the client will wait for the full body to be recieved before finalizing any requests.
   */
  body?: number;
};
```

### Recieving response body

Response bodies are sent the same way request bodies are sent. The client should join all of the packets in order to recieve the full response body.

## Connecting to WebSocket

Remote WebSocket connections can be initialized through a `PSocketConnect` packet.

```ts
type PSocketConnect = {
  /**
   * The 32 character HEX string identifying the connection.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * This value is used by the client and server to determine what kind of action is being completed.
   *
   * This value may be one of seven different values.
   *
   * ``"request" | "response" | "connect" | "open" | "close" | "message" | "error"`
   */
  type: "connect";
  /**
   * The remote URL.
   *
   * If this isn't set, the server will respond with an error.
   */
  url: string;
  /**
   * The protocols to be used when connecting to the remote.
   */
  protocols: string[];
  /**
   * Headers to be sent to the remote.
   *
   * Note that no other headers apart from what is specified here will be sent to the remote.
   */
  headers: Record<string, string>;
};
```

If the WebSocket fails to connect, the server will respond with an error.

Once the server establishes a valid connection, it will respond with a `PSocketOpen` packet. This contains information such as response headers. No WebSocket messages can be sent/recieved before this packet is received by the client.

```ts
type PSocketOpen = {
  /**
   * The 32 character HEX string identifying the response.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * This value is used by the client and server to determine what kind of action is being completed.
   *
   * This value may be one of seven different values.
   *
   * ``"request" | "response" | "connect" | "open" | "close" | "message" | "error"`
   */
  type: "open";
  /**
   * The final URL provided by the response.
   *
   * This may differ from the request URL if the server redirected the request.
   */
  url: string;
  /**
   * The protocol accepted by the remote.
   */
  protocol: string;
  /**
   * Headers to be sent to the remote.
   *
   * Note that no other headers apart from what is specified here will be sent to the remote.
   */
  headers: Record<string, string>;
};
```

### Closing a WebSocket Connection

Both the client and server may send a `PSocketClose` to close the connection. If the remote closes the connection, the server must send a `PSocketClose` packet to the client. If the client closes the connection, the client must send a `PSocketClose` packet to the server in order to close the remote socket.

```ts
type PSocketClose = {
  /**
   * The 32 character HEX string identifying the connection.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * This value is used by the client and server to determine what kind of action is being completed.
   *
   * This value may be one of seven different values.
   *
   * `"request" | "response" | "connect" | "open" | "close" | "message" | "error"`
   */
  type: "close";
  /**
   * The status code for closing the connection.
   */
  code: number;
  /**
   * The reason for closing the connection.
   */
  reason: string;
};
```

### Sending/Recieving WebSocket Messages

WebSocket messages can be sent by both the client and server using a `PSocketMessage` packet. The message data is sent the same way request/response bodies are sent. Split into packets with an ID and index value.

```ts
type PSocketMessage = {
  /**
   * The 32 character HEX string identifying the connection.
   *
   * This id represents which `PSocketConnect` packet the given message corelates to.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * This value is used by the client and server to determine what kind of action is being completed.
   *
   * This value may be one of seven different values.
   *
   * ``"request" | "response" | "connect" | "open" | "close" | "message" | "error"`
   */
  type: "message";
  /**
   * An integer value representing the size of the message in bytes.
   *
   * The client/server will wait for the full message to be recieved before forwarding the message.
   */
  data: number;
  /**
   * The data type of the message.
   */
  dataType: "text" | "binary";
};
```
