# Carbon Server v1

## Connecting to the server

Clients are able to connect to the server by opeing a WebSocket connection on `/v1/`.

Servers may selectively allow clients based off of request attributes. For example, a server may check the `Host` header provided by the client before establishing a connection.

Carbon servers may terminate the underlying WebSocket connection at any time for any reason.

If a connection gets terminated, the server will close any outgoing WebSocket connections associated with that client.

## Introduction to Packets

All [`CarbonPacket`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L5)'s are sent and recieved as a JSON stringified WebSocket messages. Each packet contains information such as an identifier, request url, request/response headers, the size of the body, etc. Each type of packet (defined by [`CarbonPacket.type`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L5)) have their own properties that modify the behavior of the server.

Any binary data that is sent over the WebSocket connection is considered body or message data. That is, the body content of a HTTP request/response or a WebSocket message from a remote.

## Understanding data communication

[`CarbonPacket`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L5)'s themselves don't contain any data such as request/response body or WebSocket message data. These resources are sent as binary messages over the Carbon server.

Carbon servers can define how, and if these resources should be sent by using its [`CarbonMeta`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/index.d.ts#L5).

[`CarbonMeta.maxPacketSize`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/index.d.ts#L25) defines how many bytes any given data packet can be, with a minimum of 1024 bytes. For data larger than this limit, we define a way of splitting it into multiple different binary messages.

Additional limits can be placed on request/response bodies by using [`CarbonMeta.maxBodySize`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/index.d.ts#L17). If the total size of the body exceeds this limit, the server will respond with a `BODY_TOO_LARGE` error. The same sort of limit can be placed on WebSocket messages between the client and a remote by using [`CarbonMeta.maxMessageSize`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/index.d.ts#L21), the server will similarly respond with a `BODY_TOO_LARGE` error if the message exceeds this defined size. These values cannot be set below 1024 bytes.

The first 16 bytes are reserved for the HEX encoded ID of a corelating [`CarbonPacket`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L5) as such `[id, id, id, id, x12, ...]`.

Because the server is able to define how big or small these packets can be, we need to be able to split them, and know what order to join them back together in.

The next 2 bytes define the index of the data packet for the given resource `[..., index, index, ...]`.

Any remaining bytes up until the defined limit are used to transmit the resource.

## Making HTTP requests

HTTP requests are made by sending a [`CarbonRequest`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L16) packet across the connection. When creating a new request, the client should generate a new, and random ID. These ID's can easily be generated using the UUID library `v4().replace(/-/g, "")`. If the client provides an invalid ID, URL, or headers, the server will respond with an `INVALID_REQUEST` error. If the server fails to make the request, it will respond with a `CONNECTION_FAILED` error.

If the client is sending a response body with the request, and the server doesn't recieve all data packets within it's defined [`CarbonMeta.requestTimeout`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/index.d.ts#L13), the server will abort the request and respond with a `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` error.

If a request body is present, the client should transmit the data using the format specified in [Understanding Data Communication](#Understanding%20data%20communication).

An example [`CarbonRequest`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L16) packet is below.

```js
{
  id: "002facd6499141979634149c3e2816fd",
  type: "request",
  method: "GET",
  url: "https://example.com/",
  headers: {
    accept: "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8"
  }
}
```

### Responding to HTTP requests

Once the server recieves a [`CarbonRequest`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L16) packet, it should fetch the resource, and return a [`CarbonResponse`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L59) packet. The ID feild of this packet should be the same as the corelating [`CarbonRequest`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L16) packet. This response packet includes information such as response headers and response status.

The [`CarbonResponse`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L59) packet for the above request should look like this.

```js
{
  id: "002facd6499141979634149c3e2816fd",
  type: "response",
  status: 200,
  statusText: "OK",
  headers: {
    "Accept-Ranges": "bytes",
    "Age": "162786",
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=604800",
    "Content-Encoding": "gzip",
    "Content-Length": "648"
  },
  body: 648
}
```

After the [`CarbonResponse`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L59) packet is sent to the client, the server should transmit the response body back to the client using the same format as request bodies but in the opposite direction.

## Connecting to WebSockets

WebSocket connections are opened using a [`CarbonRequest`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L16) packet as well.

If a [`CarbonRequest`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L16) meets all of these criteria, it will attempt to establish a remote WebSocket connection.

- The URL protocol is `ws://` or `wss://`
- The `Upgrade` header is set to `websocket`
- The `Connection` header is set to `Upgrade`

If all of these requirements are meet, the server will NOT respond with a [`CarbonResponse`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L59) packet.

If any given [`CarbonRequest`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L16) packet meets these 3 requirements, the server will attempt to open a WebSocket connection to the defined URL. If the server fails to open this connection, it will respond with a `CONNECTION_FAILED` error.

The `id` paramater of this request is used to identify messages and other events coresponding to this particular connection.

Here is an example [`CarbonRequest`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L16) that meets all of these requirements.

```js
{
  id: "4944f3de3b1a4ac4840fc77b2399b80f",
  type: "request",
  method: "GET",
  url: "wss://example.com/ws",
  headers: {
    upgrade: "websocket",
    connection: "Upgrade"
  }
}
```

Once the server has established a connection with the remote, it will send a [`CarbonOpen`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L9) packet with the same ID as the request packet back to the client. This notifies the client that messages can now be sent back and forth.

The corelating [`CarbonOpen`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L9) packet for the example above will look something along the lines of this.

```js
{
  id: "4944f3de3b1a4ac4840fc77b2399b80f",
  type: "open",
  headers: {
    upgrade: "websocket",
    connection: "Upgrade"
  }
}
```

### Sending/Recieving WebSocket messages

WebSocket messages can be transmitted both ways by using [`CarbonMessage`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L139) packets. The ID of this packet should be a new, randomly generated ID. The [`CarbonMessage.connection`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L156) value should be set to the corelating WebSocket connection's ID.

If the message ID is invalid, the server will respond with an `INVALID_REQUEST` error.

If the connection ID is invalid, the server will respond with a `UNKNOWN_REQUEST` error.

WebSocket message data is also sent using the format specified in [Understanding Data Communication](#Understanding%20data%20communication).

An example [`CarbonMessage`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L139) packet is below.

```js
{
  id: "7c9b26c9e4f94f66-b25bf99299656509",
  type: "message",
  connection: "4944f3de3b1a4ac4840fc77b2399b80f",
  dataType: "text",
  data: 12 // "Hello World!".length
}
```

### Closing WebSockets

WebSockets can be closed from either side of the connection by sending a [`CarbonClose`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L114) packet with an ID of the current connection ID.

After the server recieves or sends a [`CarbonClose`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L114) packet it should terminate the remote websocket connection.

An example [`CarbonClose`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L114) packet for the example connection may look like this.

```js
{
  id: "4944f3de3b1a4ac4840fc77b2399b80f",
  type: "close",
  code: 1000,
  reason: "Normal Closure"
}
```

## Errors

Errors are generally only sent from server to client, however client implementations may choose to send errors back to the server to be optionally logged.

Errors should always match the shape of [`CarbonError`](https://github.com/Carbon-Standards/Types/blob/main/v1.d.ts#L172) where the ID corelates to the request/message that the error was thrown within.
