# PSocket v1

## Connect to Socket

Clients should be able to connect to the socket defined by the `/v1/` endpoint.

Servers may optionaly check any request headers before upgrading the request. For example, a server may check the `Host` header provided by the client before choosing to establish a connection.

PSocket servers may terminate the underlying WebSocket connection at any time for any reason. Clients should be able to detect this and reconnect if needed. Request/Response errors should not terminate this connection.

## Request a remote resource

All requests are made via a WebSocket message. If the message is text, it is JSON stringified meta information about a given request (eg. headers). If the message is binary, it is serialized content.

A `PSocketRequest` can request and send resources as well as initialize new WebSocket connections.

```ts
type PSocketRequest = {
  /**
   * A 32 character HEX string identifying the request.
   *
   * This should be randomly generated uppon each request in order to ensure there are no response collisions.
   * If this isn't set, the server will respond with an error.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * This value is used by the server to determine what kind of action is being completed.
   *
   * This value may be one of three different values for requests and responses.
   *
   * `"request" | "response" | "error"`
   */
  type: "request";
  /**
   * A string to set request's method.
   *
   * If an invalid HTTP method is provided, the server will respond with an error.
   */
  method: string;
  /**
   * The remote URL.
   *
   * If this isn't set, the server will respond with an error.
   */
  url: string;
  /**
   * Headers to be sent to the remote.
   *
   * Note that no other headers apart from what is specified here will be sent to the remote.
   */
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  /**
   * An integer value representing the size of the body in bytes.
   *
   * If set, the server will wait for the full body to be recieved before making any requests.
   */
  body?: number;
};
```

### Sending request body

Request and response bodies are sent as multiple packets that may not exceed the server's `maxPacketSize` limit. If the `body` property is set on the initial request, the server will wait for all body packets to arrive before begining the request to the remote. The implementation may choose a timeout length for recieving all body parts. If any body packets are missing by this timeout, the server will respond with an error.

The request body is serialized into packets with a limit as defined by the server. This limit must be above 512 bytes.

The first 16 bytes are reserved for the HEX encoded request ID. `[id, id, id, id, x12]`

The next 2 bytes define the current index of the packet for the given resource. `[index, index]`

The remaining bytes can be used to serialze the request body.

## Recieving responses

Responses will be sent in the form of a `PSocketResponse` object and serialized body packets.

```ts
type PSocketResponse = {
  /**
   * The 32 character HEX string identifying the response.
   *
   * This id represents which `PSocketRequest` the given response corelates to.
   */
  id: string;
  /**
   * This value is used by the client to determine what kind of action is being completed.
   */
  type: "response";
  /**
   * The final URL provided by the response.
   *
   * This may differ from the request URL if the server redirected the request.
   */
  url: string;
  /**
   * The HTTP status code provided by the remote resource.
   */
  status: number;
  /**
   * The response headers provided by the remote.
   */
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  /**
   * An integer value representing the size of the body in bytes.
   *
   * If set, the client will wait for the full body to be recieved before finalizing any requests.
   */
  body?: number;
};
```

### Recieving response body

Response bodies are sent the same way request bodies are sent. The client should join all of the packets in order to recieve the full response body.
